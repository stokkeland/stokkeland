- 👋 Hi, I’m Thomas @stokkeland
- 👀 Interrest are all Technology - Networking/Infrastructure Cloud/OnPrem/Hybrid - Linux - Systems...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Cobol and Edlin...
- 💞️ My github account does not really have public repo's of interrest...
- 📫 How to reach me ... Stand within 1 foot and reach your arm out

Here is what AI summed me up as after looking at my past month of testing Generative stuff:
- 🛠️ Backend-focused dev & infrastructure architect
- 🐧 Linux command-line lifer (Ubuntu fan)
- 🔧 Bash, PHP, PowerShell, BGP configs — I script it all 
- 👨‍💻 vim in the trenches, VS Code for the big builds
- 💡 Light HTML/CSS when needed.
- I automate, troubleshoot, and optimize — from CLI to config, backend to edge.
